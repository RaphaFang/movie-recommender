# Movie Recommender

This project is a practice before starting my course. Its main goal is to strengthen my skills in **data cleaning** and to gradually build a complete project that can **predict users’ preferences for recommended movies**


I will primarily start with **scikit-learn**, after that, plan to explore the project with **PyTorch**. Aiming to extend the project toward more deep learning–based recommendation techniques.
